      <b>rcm</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      computes the Reverse Cuthill McKee (RCM) ordering of the nodes of a graph.
    </p>

    <p>
      The RCM ordering is frequently used when a matrix is to be
      generated whose rows and columns are numbered according to
      the numbering of the nodes.  By an appropriate renumbering
      of the nodes, it is often possible to produce a matrix with a
      much smaller bandwidth.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bandwidth of a matrix is computed as the maximum bandwidth
      of each row of the matrix.  The bandwidth of a row of the matrix
      is essentially the number of matrix entries between the first
      and last nonzero entries in the row, with the proviso that
      the diagonal entry is always treated as though it were nonzero.
    </p>

    <p>
      This library includes a few routines to handle the common case
      where the connectivity can be described in terms of a triangulation
      of the nodes, that is, a grouping of the nodes into sets of
      3-node or 6-node triangles.  The natural description of a triangulation
      is simply a listing of the nodes that make up each triangle.  The
      library includes routines for determining the adjacency structure
      associated with a triangulation, and the test problems include
      examples of how the nodes in a triangulation can be relabeled
      with the RCM permutation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a simple example of how reordering can reduce the 
      bandwidth.  In our first picture, we have nine nodes:
      <pre>
           5--7--6
           |  | /
        4--8--2
        |  |  |
        9--1--3
      </pre>
      The corresponding adjacency matrix is:
      <pre>
        * . 1 . . . . 1 1
        . * 1 . . 1 1 1 .
        1 1 * . . . . . .
        . . . * . . . 1 1
        . . . . * . 1 1 .
        . 1 . . . * 1 . .
        . 1 . . 1 1 * . .
        1 1 . 1 1 . . * .
        1 . . 1 . . . . *
      </pre>
      which has a disastrous bandwidth of 17 (lower and upper bandwidths
      of 8, and 1 for the diagonal.)
    <p>

    <p>
      If we keep the same connectivity graph, but relabel the nodes,
      we could get a picture like this:
      <pre>
           7--8--9
           |  | /
        3--5--6
        |  |  |
        1--2--4
      </pre>
      whose adjacency matrix is:
      <pre>
        * 1 1 . . . . . .
        1 * . 1 1 . . . .
        1 . * . 1 . . . .
        . 1 . * . 1 . . .
        . 1 1 . * 1 1 . .
        . . . 1 1 * . 1 1
        . . . . 1 . * 1 .
        . . . . . 1 1 * 1
        . . . . . 1 . 1 *
      </pre>
      which has a bandwidth of 7 (lower and upper bandwidths
      of 3, and 1 for the diagonal.)

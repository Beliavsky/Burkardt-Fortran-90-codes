      <b>sparse_grid_gl</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      constructs sparse grids based on 1D Gauss-Legendre rules.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sparse grids are more naturally constructed from a nested family
      of quadrature rules.  Gauss-Legendre rules are not nested, but
      have higher accuracy.  Thus, there is a tradeoff.  If we compare
      two sparse grids of the same "level", one using Gauss-Legendre rules
      and the other, say, Clenshaw-Curtis rules, then the Gauss-Legendre
      sparse grid will have higher accuracy...but also a significantly
      greater number of points.  When measuring efficiency, we really need
      to balance the cost in quadrature points against the accuracy, and
      so it is not immediately obvious which choice is best!
    </p>

    <p>
      To slightly complicate matters, Gauss-Legendre rules are very weakly
      nested, in that the rules of odd order all include the abscissa
      value X=0.0.  A sparse grid constructed from Gauss-Legendre rules
      will thus have to keep track of this minor point as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a table showing the number of points in a sparse grid based on
      Gauss-Legendre rules, indexed by the spatial dimension, and by the
      "level", which is simply an index for the family of sparse grids.

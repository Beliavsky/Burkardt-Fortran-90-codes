      <b>extract</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      pulls a copy of a Fortran 
      block data, function, module, program or subroutine from a big file, 
      and saves the copy in a little file.  
    </p>

    <p>
      I've found the code useful, 
      as an alternative to printing out a huge library of routines, or using 
      an editor to extract the seven routines I need from a collection of 200.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>extract</b> <i>module</i> <i>file.f</i>
      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>module</i> is the name of the desired module;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>file.f</i> is the file to be searched.
        </li>
      </ul>
      If the module is found, it is written to a file named <i>module.f</i>.

      catalog</a>,
      a C++ code which
      reads a C, C++, Fortran77 or Fortran90 program and prints every line 
      that begins with a special index tag.  If the program has been marked
      up expecting this convention, it is a handy way of making a table
      of contents of a program file.

      <b>f90_rule</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      computes a quadrature rule which
      estimates the integral of a function f(x), which might be defined over 
      a one dimensional region (a line) or more complex shapes such as, 
      a circle, a triangle, a quadrilateral, a polygon, or a higher dimensional
      region, and which might include an associated weight function w(x).

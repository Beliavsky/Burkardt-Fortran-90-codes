    <p>
      <b>sparse_display</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      can read information defining a matrix of numbers and display
      the sparsity pattern or location of the nonzero elements using
      gnuplot.  This operation is already available in the built-in 
      MATLAB "spy" command.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user can call "spy_ge" and pass in a matrix, in general (GE) format;
      the routine will then locate the nonzero entries, and write out a
      data file and a command file which together can be used to instruct
      gnuplot to create a sparsity plot.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the user already has a file containing a list of pairs of indices
      (I,J) corresponding to nonzero matrix entries, then the user can call 
      "spy_file", which will write out a command file only.  Together, the
      user data file and the command file can be used to instruct
      gnuplot to create a sparsity plot.

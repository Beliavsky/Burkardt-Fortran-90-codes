    <p>
      <b>ss_qg_align</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements some of the string
      matching algorithms described in the reference <b>[Chao]</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      These algorithms carry out the computation in <i>linear space</I>, and
      compute not just the optimal alignment score, but also the corresponding
      optimal alignment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <i>quasiglobal</i> matching considered here is similar to the
      global matching scheme, except that no penalty is applied for the
      very first gap (a deletion or insertion, but not both), and the very
      last one.  This simple alteration in the global alignment scheme
      facilitates the search for repeated patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines that use quadratic space are included as well, so the algorithms
      can be compared for storage, speed, and correctness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The names of the scoring and path routines include information
      about whether they use a forward, backward, or recursive algorithm,
      whether they compute the score or the path, and whether they use
      linear or quadratic space.  Thus, the routine
      <b>SS_QG_FSQ</b> uses the forward algorithm to compute the score,
      with quadratic space requirements.

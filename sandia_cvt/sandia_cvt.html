      <b>sandia_cvt</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      handles point placement, and moment determination, within arbitrary 2D
      or 3D regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program was written under contract to Sandia National Laboratory,
    </p>

    <p>
      The region is specified at a run time by an input file.  The input
      file is processed by a large geometry package known as DIATOM.
      This package is apparently a variant of a package known as CTH, both
      of which are used at Sandia.  DIATOM is written in C and FORTRAN.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sandia expected the CVT routines to be eventually included in the
      body of DIATOM, so that they would simply provide an option to
      determine point placement and moments, as part of a larger computation.
    </p>

    <p>
      For our testing, we included an interface with DIATOM, but we also
      made it possible to define the geometry of the region using a simple
      FORTRAN subroutine that simply says "yes, this point is in the region".
      By cutting out a few calls, the interface to DIATOM can be severed,
      and a standalone package can be produced for other purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a picture of the test region.  The red points lie on the boundary
      and the black points lie within.  These data points were not generated
      by the Voronoi code.  Instead, 50,000 uniformly distributed points
      were generated in the bounding box, and then those points in or on
      the region were selected.  It's hard to tell from this picture, but
      a set of points selected from a uniform distribution tend to have
      voids and clusters, which will NOT occur in a Voronoi method.

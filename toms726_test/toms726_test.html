      <b>toms726_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls toms726(), which
      computes recursion relationships for various families of
      orthogonal polynomials, as well as the abscissas and weights of
      related quadrature rules;
      the library is commonly called ORTHPOL, and is
      by Walter Gautschi.

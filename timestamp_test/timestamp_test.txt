timestamp_test():
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test timestamp().
 
TEST01
  TIMESTAMP prints out the current wallclock time,
  including the year, month, day, hours, minutes,
  seconds, thousandths of a second, and AM/PM.
 
  This can be useful in keeping track of the date
  of execution of a particular program
  or to give a rough idea of the length of time
  required to run a program.

TEST02
  TIMESTRING returns the current wallclock time,
  including the year, month, day, hours, minutes,
  seconds, thousandths of a second, and AM/PM
  in a string, which the user may print or manipulate.
 
  TIMESTRING returned the value "17 September 2021  11:54:32.272 PM".
 
TEST03
  HMS_CURRENT_PRINT prints out the current HMS time
  (hours, minutes, seconds, thousandths of a second,
  and AM/PM) followed by a user-specified string.
 
  This might be useful in figuring out what routines
  are taking a long time.
 
Wallclock:  11:54:32.272 PM    Call random_number 1000 times.
Wallclock:  11:54:32.273 PM    Compute sine of random numbers.
Wallclock:  11:54:32.273 PM    All done!
  
   Computed value =    9566.9466707895390     
 
TEST04
  HMS_DELTA_PRINT prints out the delta HMS time
  (hours, minutes, seconds, thousandths of a second,
  and AM/PM) followed by a user-specified string.
 
  This might be useful in figuring out what routines
  are taking a long time.
 
Delta Wallclock:  0:00:00.000    Zero out the clock.
Delta Wallclock:  0:00:00.001    Time to compute random numbers.
Delta Wallclock:  0:00:00.002    Time to compute sine of random numbers.
  
   Computed value =    95963.002214234250     
 
timestamp_test()
  Normal end of execution.

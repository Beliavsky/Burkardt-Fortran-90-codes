      <b>graph_adj_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls graph_adj(), which
      carries out operations on abstract graphs, with undirected edges,
      represented by an adjacency matrix.  Operations include breadth-first
      search, the computation of a minimum spanning tree,
      an Euler or Hamilton circuit, blocks, chromatic polynomial, or transitive
      closure.

      <b>ss_lg_align</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements some of the string
      matching algorithms described by Chao.
    </p>

    <p>
      These algorithms look for optimal local alignments of two strings
      using linear space.  (Compare the global alignment routines in
      <a href = "../ss_gg_align/ss_gg_align.html">SS_GG_ALIGN</a>.)
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to be able to compute alignments using "linear space",
      that is, just a few vectors whose length <b>N</b> is equal to that
      of a typical string.  A quadratic algorithm would require a two
      dimensional array of total dimension <b>N*N</b>.  Realistic alignment
      problems can involve strings of <b>N</b>=100,000 elements or more,
      so a quadratic algorithm would be expensive or impossible to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      The "matching" being considered does not actually require that every
      element of string <b>A</b> match an identical element of string <b>B</b>.
      Instead, the matching algorithm is essentially looking for the highest
      scoring way of associating a portion of one string with a portion of the
      other, allowing the operations of "mutation" (change one letter to
      another), "deletion" (drop a string of consecutive letters) and
      "insertion (insert a string of consecutive letters).  Thus, at the same
      time, we are measuring a sort of evolutionary distance between two
      strings and a formal "editing distance" between them.
    </p>

    <p>
      This set of routines assumes that an insertion or deletion of length
      <b>K</b> is penalized using an "affine gap penalty formula" of the form:
      <blockquote>
        Penalty = Gap_Open + K * Gap_Extend
      </blockquote>
      This choice of penalty function has a major effect on the form
      of the matching algorithms, particularly in the linear space case.
    </p>

    <p>
      The score for the actual best matching is determined without explicitly
      constructing the best matching.  It is a matter of some
      difficulty to recover the matching corresponding to the best score.
      This is particularly true if the algorithm is a linear space one, which
      discards a great deal of intermediate information.  However, it is
      possible to set up a recursive algorithm which determines the best
      alignment, using only linear space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines that use quadratic space are included as well, so the algorithms
      can be compared for storage, speed, and correctness.
    </p>

    <p>
      The names of the scoring and path routines include information
      about whether they use a forward, backward, or recursive algorithm,
      whether they compute the score or the path, and whether they use
      linear or quadratic space.  Thus, the routine
      <b>SS_LG_FSQ</b> uses the forward algorithm to compute the score,
      with quadratic space requirements.

    <p>
      <b>quadpack</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      estimates integrals using numerical quadrature,
      using double precision arithmetic,
      by Piessens, deDoncker-Kapenga, Ueberhuber, and Kahaner.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are routines for nonadaptive
      or adaptive integration, finite, semi-infinite or fully infinite
      integration regions, integrands with singularities, and integrands
      that include a factor of SIN(X) or COS(X).
    </p>

    </p>
      Many subroutines come in two versions, a "simple" interface and
      an "extended" interface.  Compare, for example, the routines
      QAWF and QAWFE.  The first one simply makes sensible choices for
      many parameter values.  The second one gives the user full control
      over all the parameters.

    <h3>
      Routines for a finite region:
    </h3>

    <p>
      How to decide what routine to use, if your integration region
      is finite:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you can factor the integrand as F(X)=W(X)*G(X), where G
          is smooth on [A,B] and W(X)=COS(OMEGA*X) or SIN(OMEGA*X) then 
          use QAWO.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if you can factor F(X)=W(X)*G(X) where G is smooth
          and W(X)=(X-A)**ALFA * (B-X)**BETA * (LOG(X-A))**L * (LOG(B-X))**K
          with K, L = 0 or 1, and ALFA, BETA greater than -1, then use QAWS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if you can factor F(X)=W(X)*G(X) where G is smooth
          and W(X)=1/(X-C) for some constant C, use QAWC.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if you do not care too much about possible
          inefficient use of computer time, and do not want to further
          analyze the problem, use QAGS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if the integrand is smooth, use QNG or QAG.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if there are discontinuities or singularities
          of the integrand or of its derivative, and you know where they
          are, split the integration range at these points and analyze
          each subinterval.  You can also use QAGP, which is to be provided
          with the x-locations of the singularities or discontinuities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if the integrand has end point singularities, use QAGS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if the integrand has an oscillatory behavior of
          nonspecific type, and no singularities, use QAG with KEY=6.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, use QAGS.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
      Routines for an infinite region:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the integrand decays rapidly to zero, truncate the
          interval and use the finite interval decision tree.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if the integrand oscillates over the entire infinite range,
          and the integral is a Fourier transform, use QAWF.
        </li>
        <li>
          Or, if the integrand oscillates over the entire infinite range,
          but is not a Fourier transform, then sum the successive positive 
          and negative contributions by integrating between the zeroes of the
          integrand.  Apply convergence acceleration with QELG.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if you are not constrained by computer time, and
          do not wish to analyze the problem further, use QAGI.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, if the integrand has a non-smooth behavior in
          the range, and you know where it occurs, split off these regions
          and use the appropriate finite range routines to integrate over
          them.  Then begin this tree again to handle the remainder of the region.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, truncation of the interval, or application of
          a suitable transformation for reducing the problem to a finite
          range may be possible.  And you may also call QAGI.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <p>
      <b>rk2_implicit</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      solves one or more ordinary differential equations (ODE)
      using a Runge-Kutta order 2 implicit method, with a version of
      fsolve() handling the associated nonlinear equation,
      and using a fixed time step.  This method is often called the
      (implicit) midpoint method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each step requires the solution of an implicit nonlinear
      equation representing a backward Euler step.  A corresponding
      function has been devised, called fsolve_be(), which carries out
      the iterative solution process.

      f90_ode</a>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      solves one or more differential equations (ODE) using a method of a
      particular order, either explicit or implicit.  Some methods require
      a nonlinear equation solver.  Some methods used a fixed stepsize,
      while others adapt the stepsize based on an error estimate.

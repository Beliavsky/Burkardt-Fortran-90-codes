      <b>HB_IO</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      reads and writes files in the Harwell Boeing sparse matrix format.
    </p>

    <p>
      A special feature of HB_IO is the routine HB_FILE_READ(),
      which can read all the information from an HBSMC file of arbitrary
      size.  The data can then be accessed by the user by "using"
      the module <i>HB_FILE_MODULE</i>.  Suggestions on how to compile,
      store and access the module are sketched out in the sample problem
      source code and in the command files.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the most common "flavor" of HBSMC file is an assembled
      sparse matrix, but that there are some lesser used options,
      including storage of the matrix as unassembled finite element
      matrices, and corresponding storage of vectors.  These secondary
      options are less well documented, and are only marginally supported
      in this package.

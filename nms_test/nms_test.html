      <b>nms_test</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      calls nms(), which
      includes a wide variety of numerical software, including
      solvers for linear systems of equations, 
      a piecewise Hermie cubic (PWH) interpolation package (PCHIP),
      numerical quadrature, linear least squares data fitting,
      the solution of nonlinear equations, 
      ordinary differential equations (ODE),
      optimization and nonlinear least squares (NLS), simulation and random
      numbers, trigonometric approximation and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).

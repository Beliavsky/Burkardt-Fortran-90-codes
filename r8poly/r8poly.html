      <b>r8poly</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      operates on real polynomials, including evaluation, differentiation,
      integration, multiplication, synthetic division, shifting the
      base, computing a power, taking the norm.  It also defines
      Chebyshev, Lagrange and Legendre polynomials.

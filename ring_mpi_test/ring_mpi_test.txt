ring_mpi():
  FORTRAN90/MPI version
  Measure time required to transmit data around
  a ring of processes
 
  The number of processes is        8
 
  Timings based on     10 experiments
  N double precision values were sent
  in a ring transmission starting and ending at process 0
  and using a total of      8 processes.

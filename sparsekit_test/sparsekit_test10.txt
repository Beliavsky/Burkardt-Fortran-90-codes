SPARSEKIT_PRB10
  FORTRAN90 version
 
 This program demonstrates the use of GEN57BL
 to generate a block sparse matrix derived from a 5 or
 7 point stencil on an NX by NY by NZ grid.
  
 In this example, the block size is 3.
  
 The matrix is then stored in Harwell-Boeing format
 in a file, using routine PRTMT.

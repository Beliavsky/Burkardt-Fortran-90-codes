    <p>
      <b>stripack_voronoi</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      interactively determines the Voronoi diagram of a set of points
      on a sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The set of points is read from a file, and the Voronoi diagram,
      once computed, is written out to another file, described by a
      set of Voronoi vertices, and the indices of Voronoi vertices that
      form Voronoi polygons.

      </blockquote>
      where
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>node_filename</i> is the name of a file containing the (X,Y,Z) coordinates of
          points on the unit sphere.

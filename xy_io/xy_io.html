      <b>xy_io</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      reads and writes simple graphics files in the XY, XYL and XYF formats.
    </p>

    <p>
      XY files are a simple way of storing information about sets of points in 2D.
    </p>

    <p>
      An XY file has a simple structure.  There are three kinds of records:
      <ul>
        <li>
          COMMENT LINES begin with the character '#' and are ignored;
        </li>
        <li>
          BLANK LINES are ignored;
        </li>
        <li>
          COORDINATE LINES each contain one pair of X, Y coordinates;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of an XY file containing 13 points:
      <pre>
#  house.xy
#
        0.000000        0.000000
        6.000000        0.000000
        6.000000        7.000000
        3.000000       10.000000
        0.000000        7.000000
        4.000000        1.000000
        5.000000        1.000000
        5.000000        4.000000
        4.000000        4.000000
        5.000000        8.000000
        5.000000       11.000000
        4.000000       11.000000
        4.000000        9.000000
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, in many cases, we would like to describe LINES between the points.
      We can add this information by including a second file, called an XYL file,
      which consists of a string of point indices.  A line is drawn from one point
      to the next and so on.  Each list of points is on a separate record.  Thus, an XYL file
      associated with the above XY file might be:
      <pre>
#  house.xyl
#
 1 2 3 4 5 1
 6 7 8 9 6
 10 11 12 13
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We might also like to describe FACES defined by the points.
      We can add this information by including a file, called an XYF file,
      which consists of a string of point indices.  A face is defined by
      listing in counterclockwise order the vertices that lie on it.
      No terminating "-1" is needed, and the first vertex is not repeated
      as the final vertex. Thus, an XYF file
      associated with the above XY file might be:
      <pre>
#  house.xyf
#
 1 2 3 4 5
 6 7 8 9
 10 11 12 13
      </pre>
    </p>

TRIANGULATION_ORIENT
  FORTRAN90 version
  Read a node dataset of NODE_NUM points in 2 dimensions.
  Read an associated triangle file of TRIANGLE_NUM 
  triangles using 3 or 6 nodes.
 
  Ensure that every triangle has positive orientation.
 
  Write the reoriented triangle file.
 
  Read the header of "p15_nodes.txt".
 
  Spatial dimension DIM_NUM =        2
  Number of nodes NODE_NUM  =      614
 
  Read the data in "p15_nodes.txt".

MESH_BASE_ONE:
  The element indexing appears to be 1-based!
  No conversion is necessary.
 
TRIANGULATION_ORIENT - Warning!
  You have      512 triangles with
  negative area.
 
  We have reoriented these triangles to have positive
  area, and written the new triangle data to 
  the triangle file "p15_orient_elements.txt".

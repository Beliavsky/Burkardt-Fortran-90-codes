legendre_rule():
  FORTRAN90 version
  Compute a Gauss-Legendre rule for approximating
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.
 
  The user specifies:
  * ORDER, the number of points:
  * A, the left endpoint:
  * B, the right endpoint:
  * FILENAME, used to generate 3 filenames:
  --  filename_w.txt - the weight file
  --  filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
  --  filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  ORDER =        4
  A =   -1.00000    
  B =    1.00000    
  FILENAME = "leg_o4".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "leg_o4".
 
  Weight file will be   "leg_o4_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "leg_o4_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "leg_o4_r.txt".
 
LEGENDRE_RULE():
  Normal end of execution.

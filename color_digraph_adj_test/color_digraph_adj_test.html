      <b>color_digraph_adj_test</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      calls color_digraph_adj(), which
      carries out operations on color digraphs, a directed graph in which 
      each node has been assignd a color.  That information is stored in
      an adjacency matrix in which the diagonal elements record colors.
      Operations include counting the colors, computing in- and out-degrees,
      computing the in- and out-degree sequences, counting the edges,
      printing the adjacency matrix, and generating fixed and random examples.

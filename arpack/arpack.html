      <b>arpack</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      is a numerical software library for solving large scale eigenvalue 
      problems.  The package is designed to compute a few eigenvalues and 
      corresponding eigenvectors of large sparse or structured matrices, 
      using the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method (IRAM) or, in the case 
      of symmetric matrices, the corresponding variant of the Lanczos 
      algorithm.  It is used by many popular numerical computing environments 
      such as SciPy, Mathematica, GNU Octave and MATLAB to provide this 
      functionality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code supports single and double precision, real or complex
      arithmetic.  The matrices involved can be symmetric or nonsymmetric.
      The user can request just a few eigenvalues, or all of them.  There
      are special routines for banded matrices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the package uses reverse communication, the user is
      free to store the matrix in any way suitable.  The code
      will never require direct access to the matrix, only to
      the value of certain matrix-vector products such as <b>A*x</b>
      or <b>A'*x</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code requires access to the lapack() and blas() libraries.

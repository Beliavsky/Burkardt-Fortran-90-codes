      <b>tetrahedron_witherden_rule</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      returns a symmetric Witherden quadrature rule for the tetrahedron,
      with exactness up to total degree 10.
    </p>

    <p>
     The data is given for the tetrahedron:
     with vertices (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1).
    </p>

    <p>
     We suppose we are given a tetrahedron T with vertices A, B, C, D.
     We call a rule with n points, returning barycentric coordinates
     a, b, c, d, and weights w.  Then the integral I of f(x,y,z) over T is 
     approximated by Q as follows:
    <pre>
      (x,y,z) = a(1:n) * A + b(1:n) * B + c(1:n) * C + d(1:n) * D
      Q = volume(T) * sum ( 1 <= i <= n ) w(i) * f(x(i),y(i),z(i)) 
     </pre>

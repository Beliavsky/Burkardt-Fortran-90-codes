    <p>
      <b>polygon_triangulate</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      triangulates a possibly nonconvex polygon in 2D,
      and which can use gnuplot to display the external edges and 
      internal diagonals of the triangulation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The polygon is defined by an input file which gives the coordinates
      of the vertices of the polygon, in counterclockwise order.
    </p>

    <p>
      No consecutive pair of vertices should be equal; when describing a
      polygon, sometimes the first and last vertices are equal.  For this
      program, that is not the case.  To describe a square, your input
      file should contain four pairs of coordinates, for instance.
    </p>

    <p>
      The vertices should be listed in counterclockwise order.  If you list
      them in clockwise order, then the function will refuse to operate
      on the data.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is possible to create a polygon that has zero area.  The function
      will refuse to process such an object.
    </p>

    <p>
      This function cannot triangulate a polygon which includes one or
      more "holes".  That is actually a significantly more difficult
      task.
    </p>

    <p>
      The polygon does not need to be convex.  However, you should be careful
      not to specify a polygon which crosses itself, since this means the
      interior of the polygon is not well defined, and hence a triangulation
      is not well defined.  As a simple example of such a problem, consider
      the four vertices of a square in counterclockwise order: V1, V2, V3, V4,
      and list them instead as V1, V3, V2, V4.  This shape cannot be 
      triangulated in the usual sense.  However, the function may not
      realize this, in which case it will return what it thinks is a
      reasonable triangulation of the (unreasonable) data.
    </p>

    <p>
      The output of the program is a list of the N-3 triples of nodes that 
      form the triangles of the triangulation.

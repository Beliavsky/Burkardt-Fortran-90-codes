      <b>asa113</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      divides M points in N dimensions into K clusters
      seeking the division which minimizes a user-defined criterion,
      by Banfield and Bassill.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is in some sense a generalization of the K-means algorithm,
      because the user is allowed to choose the criterion function to be
      minimized, and because the algorithm considers both all possible transfers
      of an object from one class to another, and all possible exchanges that
      swap two objects.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, because it is <i>not</i> a K-means algorithm,
      there is a significant amount of work off-loaded onto the user, and
      the task of evaluating the change in the criterion function can be far
      more expensive than in the K-means setting, and the consideration of
      all possible exchanges can result in an explosion in the running time
      for large data sets.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, the algorithm should not be the first choice if a K-means
      calculation is really what is desired, and it may be far too expensive
      to use if the size of the data set is significant.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is Applied Statistics Algorithm 113.

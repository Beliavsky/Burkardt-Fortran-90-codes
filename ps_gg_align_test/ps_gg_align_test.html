      <b>ps_gg_align_test</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      calls ps_gg_align(), which
      implements global string alignment algorithms which work in linear space,
      and compute both the optimal score and the optimal alignment.
      Gaps in the alignment are assigned an affine gap penalty.
      The algorithms are due to Chao.

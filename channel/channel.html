    <p>
      <b>channel</b>,
      a Fortran90 program which
      computes the time-independent flow
      of a viscous incompressible fluid in a 2D channel.
    </p>

    <p>
      The strength
      of the flow at the inlet is determined by a parameter.
      The desired flow profile along a line downstream is given.  The task is
      to determine the inflow parameter that generates a flow that minimizes
      the difference with the given profile data.

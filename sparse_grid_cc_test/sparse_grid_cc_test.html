      <b>sparse_grid_cc_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls sparse_grid_cc(), which
      computes the points and weights of a Smolyak sparse
      grid, based on a 1-dimensional Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rule,
      to be used for efficient and accurate quadrature in multiple dimensions.

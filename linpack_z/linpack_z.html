      <b>linpack_z</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which 
      solves systems of linear
      equations for a variety of matrix types and storage modes,
      by Jack Dongarra, Jim Bunch, Cleve Moler, Pete Stewart.

    <p>
      LINPACK has officially been superseded by the LAPACK library.  The LAPACK
      library uses more modern algorithms and code structure.  However,
      the LAPACK library can be extraordinarily complex; what is done
      in a single LINPACK routine may correspond to 10 or 20 utility 
      routines in LAPACK.  This is fine if you treat LAPACK as a black
      box.  But if you wish to learn how the algorithm works, or 
      to adapt it, or to convert the code to another language, this
      is a real drawback.  This is one reason I still keep a copy
      of LINPACK around.

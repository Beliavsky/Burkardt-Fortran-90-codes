      <b>nas</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      is a revision of David Bailey's NASA kernel benchmark program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The benchmark program was developed around 1984, and
      measured computational performance on a representative range
      of realistic calculations.  One motivation for this benchmark was
      to move beyond the LINPACK benchmark, which focussed on a single
      highly structured procedure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Benchmarking computers has become much more difficult now that
      memory, I/O, multicores and distributed memory have all become
      significant factors in computing performance.  Nonetheless, the
      NAS benchmarks provide an interesting insight into the floating
      point processing power of a system, and so, for this reason, a
      version of the program has been created that retains the functionality
      of the original, while being somewhat easier to transfer to
      other languages.

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>nas</b>
      </blockquote>
      runs the program, and prints the error, timing, and MegaFLOPS results.

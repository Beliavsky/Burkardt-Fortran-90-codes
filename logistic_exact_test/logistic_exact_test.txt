logistic_exact_test():
  Fortran90 version
  logistic_exact() evaluates exact solutions of
  the logistic ODE.

  parameters:
    r     =    1.00000    
    k     =    1.00000    
    t0    =    0.00000    
    y0    =   0.500000    
    tstop =    8.00000    

  Evaluate exact solution for varied values of y0:
    y0 =   0.500000E-01
    y0 =   0.100000    
    y0 =   0.200000    
    y0 =   0.500000

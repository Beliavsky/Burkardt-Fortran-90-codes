      <b>circle_segment</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out various computations associated with a circle segment,
      using gnuplot to illustrate some of the computations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Begin with a circle of radius R.  Choose two points P1 and P2 on the
      circle, and draw the chord P1:P2.  This chord divides the circle
      into two pieces, each of which is called a circle segment.
      Consider one of the pieces.  The "angle" THETA of this segment is the 
      angle P1:C:P2, where C is the center of the circle.  Let Q be the point 
      on the chord P1:P2 which is closest to C.  The "height" H of the segment
      is the distance from Q to the perimeter of the circle.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code considers various computations, including:
      <ul>
        <p>
          Determine the angle THETA, given R and H.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the height H, given R and THETA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the height H, given R and AREA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the width W, given R and H.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the area, given R and H.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine the centroid, given R and H.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select points uniformly at random from a segment, given R and H.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine a cumulative density function (CDF) for the height H2
          of a circle segment defined by a point selected at random from
          a circle segment of height H.
        </p>
        <p>
          Determine a quadrature rule that can be used to estimate integrals
          of functions f(x,y) over the segment.
        </p>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The code creates some graphics plots using gnuplot().

    <p>
      <b>graph_arc_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls graph_arc(), which
      carries out operations on graphs.
      Information is stored in an arc list, pairs of nodes forming edges.
      Operations include the chromatic polynomial, computing degrees,
      computing the degree sequence, counting the edges,
      determining edge and node connectivity, Euler circuits,
      spanning trees, shortest path,
      printing the arc list, generating fixed and random examples.

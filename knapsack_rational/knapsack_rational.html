      <b>knapsack_rational</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      solves the rational knapsack problem, in which a knapsack of limited
      weight capacity is filled with profitable items.  This variation of
      the 0/1 knapsack problem allows a fractional part of an item to
      be included in the knapsack.  The result is an upper bound on the
      maximum possible profit for the 0/1 knapsack problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The rational knapsack problem is a generalization of the 0/1 knapsack
      problem.  It is mainly used to derive a bounding function for the
      0/1 knapsack problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      The 0/1 knapsack problem is as follows:
      <pre>
      Given:
        a set of N objects,
        a profit P(I) and weight W(I) associated with each object,
        and a weight limit MASS_LIMIT,
      Determine:
        a set of choices X(I) which are 0 or 1, that maximizes the profit
          P = Sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) P(I) * X(I)
        subject to the constraint
          Sum ( 1 <= I <= N ) W(I) * X(I) <= MASS_LIMIT.
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      By contrast, the rational knapsack problem allows the values X(I)
      to be any value between 0 and 1.  A solution for the rational knapsack
      problem is known.  Arrange the objects in order of their "profit density"
      ratios P(I)/W(I), and then take in order as many of these as you can.
      If you still have "room" in the weight constraint, then you should
      take the maximal fraction of the very next object, which will complete
      your weight limit, and maximize your profit.
    </p>

    <p>
      If should be obvious that, given the same data, a solution for
      the rational knapsack problem will always have a profit that is
      at least as high as for the 0/1 problem.  Since the rational knapsack
      maximum profit is easily computed, this makes it a useful bounding
      function.

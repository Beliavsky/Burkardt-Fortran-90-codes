      <b>polynomial_conversion</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      converts representations of a polynomial between monomial, Bernstein,
      Chebyshev, Gegenbauer, Hermite, Laguerre and Legendre forms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The monomial or power sum representation of a polynomial of degree n
      involves a vector a of coefficients, and has the form:
      <pre>
        p(x) = a(0) + a(1) * x + a(2) * x^2 + ... + a(n) * x^n
      </pre>
      A Chebyshev representation, for instance, will use a different
      vector c of coefficients, and Chebyshev basis functions T(x) so that
      <pre>
        p(x) = c(0) T0(x) + c(1) * T1(x) + c(2) * T2(x) + ... + c(n) * Tn(x)
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is the task of this software to take the coefficients for one
      representation, and determine the corresponding coefficients in
      another specified representation.

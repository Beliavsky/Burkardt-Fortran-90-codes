    <p>
      <b>tiler_2d</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      demonstrates how to
      graphically "tile" a 2D box with a repeated pattern, using 
      transfinite interpolation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The box has been divided into subregions that are not rectilinear,
      nor the same size or shape.  A simple "tile pattern" of the letter "R"
      is used.  The program must stretch and twist the pattern to fit into
      each subregion.  The resulting tiled object is written out as a PostScript
      file.

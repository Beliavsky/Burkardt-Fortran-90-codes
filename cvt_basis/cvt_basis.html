    <p>
      <b>cvt_basis</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      uses discrete Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) techniques to
      produce a small set of basis vectors that are good cluster centers
      for a large set of data vectors;
    </p>

    <p>
      The clustering process uses the K-Means algorithm, which can be
      considered to be a discrete version of the CVT algorithm.
    </p>

    <p>
      The data is a collection of vectors, with each vector stored in
      a separate file.  The files are presumed to have "sequential" names,
      such as "fred01.txt", "fred02.txt", and so on.  Each file must be a
      TABLE file, that is
      a series of N lines, with M values on every line (although
      comment lines may be inserted as well.)
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is given the name of the first file in the sequence.
      It reads the data from each file in the sequence, and carries out
      the K Means clustering process to determine K cluster centers.
      It writes each of these cluster centers out to a separate file.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cluster centers will generally be "well spread out" in the space
      spanned by the set of data.  Such a set might be useful, for instance,
      in determining a basis for a low-dimensional approximation of the
      data.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>INPUT</b>: at run time, the user specifies:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>uv0_file</i>, the name of the first data file (the code
          will assume all the files are numbered consecutively).
          Note that you may now specify more than one set of solution families.
          Enter "none" if there are no more families, or else the name of the
          first file in the next family.  Up to 10 separate families of
          files are allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>cluster_lo, cluster_hi</i>, the range of cluster sizes to check.
          In most cases, you simply want to specify the <b>same number</b>
          for both these values, namely, the requested basis size.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>cluster_it_max</i>, the number of different times you want to
          try to cluster the data; I often use 15.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>energy_it_max</i>, the number of times you want to try to improve
          a given clustering by swapping points from one cluster to another;
          I often use 50 or 100.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>comment</i>, "Y" if initial comments may be included in the
          beginning of the output files.  These comments always start with
          a "#" character in column 1.
        </li>
      </ul>

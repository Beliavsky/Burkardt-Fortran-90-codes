      <b>toms178</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      uses the Hooke-Jeeves direct search algorithm to seek the minimizing
      point of a function F(X) of several variables,
      by Arthur Kaupe.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Hooke_Jeeves algorithm does not required the function F(X) to
      be differentiable.  It does not even require the function to be
      continuous, although it should probably only be "weakly discontinuous",
      like a step function, with finitely many well-separated jumps.  In any
      case, the algorithm only examines function values, never derivatives,
      remembers the location of the best value encountered, and seeks to
      improve this value by a clever pattern search.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user supplies a quantity <b>rho</b>, between 0 and 1, which controls
      how cautious or daring the search is, as well as a routine to evaluate the
      function, and a few input parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
      A C version of the algorithm, as written by Mark Johnson,
      is available at

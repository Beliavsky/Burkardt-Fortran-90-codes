      <b>fsolve</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      solves systems of nonlinear equations,
      inspired by the fsolve() function in minpack(), 
      with special interfaces fsolve_bdf2(), fsolve_be() and
      fsolve_tr() for handling systems associated
      with implicit ODE solvers of type bdf2, backward Euler,
      midpoint, or trapezoidal.

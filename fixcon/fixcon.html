      <b>fixcon</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      converts the line continuation scheme used in a Fortran77
      file to that used in Fortran90 files.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Fortran77, if a line
      is not a comment line, then a nonblank character (actually, the character
      can't be '0' either) in column six indicates that the current line is a
      continuation of the previous one.  (Complications include what happens
      when the previous line is a comment, and how you deal with the joy
      of TAB characters).  For example, the following would be a legally
      continued line in Fortran 77 (assuming that the dollar sign is
      actually in column 6):
      </p><pre>            x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4
           $  + 5 + 6
      </pre>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      In Fortran90, a line can extend to the next line by having an
      ampersand as its last character.  Thus, the Fortran90 version
      of the same line looks like this:
      </p><pre>            x = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 &amp;
              + 5 + 6
      </pre>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      <b>FIXCON</b> reads a file that uses the Fortran77 convention, and writes
      a copy that uses the F90 convention.  If you've ever tried to do this
      by hand on a substantial file, it might be worth your while to try
      this program instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      With nose firmly squeezed shut, the program has been modified to
      try to deal with the evil of TAB characters.  The program's treatment
      is simply to replace each TAB by six blanks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Two other small fixes are applied.
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, the code will only read the first 72 columns of input.
          Fortran77 allows you to put any junk you want beyond column
          72, but it will not be seen by the compiler).
        </li>
        <li>
          Secondly, all lines that look like comment lines (beginning
          with a <b>C</b> or <b>c</b> or <b>D</b> or <b>d</b> or <b>*</b>)
          are modified to use the Fortran90 comment convention of
          beginning with an exclamation mark.
        </li>
      </ul>

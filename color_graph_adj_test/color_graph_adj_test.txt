color_graph_adj_test():
  FORTRAN90 version
  color_graph_adj() implements graph algorithms.
 
color_graph_adj_connect_random_test():
  color_graph_adj_connect_random_test() returns a random 
  connected color graph;
 
 
  Random object is to have:
  Number of colors =        3
  Number of nodes =         6
  Number of edges =         8
 
  The graph:
 
 1    0  0  0  0  1  0
 2    0  0  1  0  1  0
 3    0  1  0  1  0  1
 4    0  0  1  0  0  0
 5    1  1  0  0  0  0
 6    0  0  1  0  0  0
 
  The graph IS edgewise connected.
  The graph IS nodewise connected.
 
  Number of edges is        5
  Number of colors is           1
  Maximum color index is        0
 
color_graph_adj_random_test():
  color_graph_adj_random_test() returns a random color digraph.
 
 
  Random object is to have:
  Number of colors =        3
  Number of nodes =        6
  Number of edges =        7
 
  The color graph:
 
 1    3  0  1  1  0  0
 2    0  3  0  1  1  0
 3    1  0  2  0  1  0
 4    1  1  0  1  0  1
 5    0  1  1  0  3  1
 6    0  0  0  1  1  2
 
  Number of edges is        7
  Number of colors is           3
  Maximum color index is        3
 
color_graph_adj_test():
  Normal end of execution.

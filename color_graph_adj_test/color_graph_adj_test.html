      <b>color_graph_adj_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls color_graph_adj(), which
      carries out operations on color graphs, an undirected graph in which 
      each node has been assigned a color.  That information is stored in
      an adjacency matrix in which the diagonal elements record colors.
      Operations include counting the colors, computing degrees,
      computing the degree sequences, counting the edges,
      printing the adjacency matrix, and generating fixed and random examples.

  for "subanagrams", that is, words formed by using 
  some (possibly all) of the letters of the master word.
 
  Master word: "amsterdam".
  Sorted:      "aademmrst".
 
  Minimum subanagrams length:        4
  Maximum subanagrams length:        9
 
    300394  words checked;
    155829  words checked that were the right length;
       270  words checked that were the right length AND subanagrams.
 
  The subanagrams were written to the file "amsterdam.txt".

sandia_cvt_test():
  FORTRAN90 version
  Test SANDIA_CVT().
  A sample problem for the probabilistic
  Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation algorithm.
 
  Given a region in 2D or 3D, the problem is to determine
  GENERATORS, a set of points which define a division
  of the region into Voronoi cells, which are also
  CENTROIDS of the Voronoi cells.
 
 
Geometry parameters:
-------------------
 
  The spatial dimension is NDIM =        3
 
  The minimum corner of the bounding box is:
   0.00000       0.00000       0.00000    
  The maximum corner of the bounding box is:
   100.000       100.000       20.0000    
 
  a simple routine determines the region.
 
CVT Algorithm parameters:
-------------------------
 
  The number of Voronoi cells to generate:     1024
  Number of iterations to determine CVT:       10
  Number of sampling points per Voronoi cell:     5000
  Voronoi cell generators are initialized by Halton.
 
 
Moment parameters:
------------------
 
  Number of sampling points per Voronoi cell:     5000
 
  The volume of the region is given.
  It is specified as REGION_VOLUME =    34000.0    
 
 
Nearest Neighbor Search parameters:
-----------------------------------
 
 
  The nearest neighbor search is speeded up by using bins.
  The bounding box is to be divided up into bins.
  The number of bins is :
      25      25       5
 
 
Miscellaneous parameters:
------------------------
 
  Generator and moment output files will NOT be written.

  Percentage nonempty bins =          18.0
  Number of points per bin =           0.327680    
  Number of points per nonempy bin =    1.82206    
 
  Volume of bounding box is        200000.    
  Given volume of region is        34000.0

      <b>nms</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      includes a wide variety of numerical software, including
      solvers for linear systems of equations, 
      a piecewise Hermie cubic (PWH) interpolation package (PCHIP),
      numerical quadrature, linear least squares data fitting,
      the solution of nonlinear equations, 
      ordinary differential equations (ODE),
      optimization and nonlinear least squares (NLS), simulation and random
      numbers, trigonometric approximation and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT).
    </p>

    <p>
      The code accompanies the text
      "Numerical Methods and Software".  The book is a modern discussion
      of current numerical algorithms and software.  The software that comes
      with the book has been extracted from standard software libraries,
      particularly the SLATEC code.  Thus the book is also a good
      introduction to the use of a portion of the SLATEC code, which
      does not have a widely available solid hardcopy reference.
    </p>

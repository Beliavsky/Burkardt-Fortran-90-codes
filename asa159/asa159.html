      <b>asa159</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      constructs a table having given row and column sums,
      by Michael Patefield;
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is Applied Statistics Algorithm 159.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code accepts a table shape (the number of rows and columns),
      and two vectors, the lists of row and column sums.  There may be 0, 1, or
      many tables with nonnegative, integral entries that have the given
      shape and sums.  The routine will report the case if there are no
      candidates.  If there is at least one candidate, then the routine
      will choose one, uniformly over the number of distinct candidates.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, suppose M = 2, N = 3, row sum = (/ 6, 5 /) and
      column sum = (/ 3, 4, 4 /), then here are two tables that satisfy
      the constraints:
      <pre>
        1  2  3
        2  2  1
      </pre>
      and
      <pre>
        3  0  3
        0  4  1
      </pre>
    </p>

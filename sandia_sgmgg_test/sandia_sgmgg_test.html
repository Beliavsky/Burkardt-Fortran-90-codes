      <b>sandia_sgmgg_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls sandia_sgmgg(), which
      contains some experimental code for the investigation of sparse
      grids constructed in a generalized fashion, in which the set of
      indices corresponding to a sparse grid is chosen in a generalized
      way, rather than being defined by a linear constraint.

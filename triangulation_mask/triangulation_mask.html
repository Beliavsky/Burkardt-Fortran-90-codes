    <p>
      <b>triangulation_mask</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      reads the nodes and triangles that define a triangulation, 
      calls a user routine which determines whether each triangle is to
      be preserved or discarded ("masked") from the triangulation,
      and writes out new node and triangle files that define the
      masked triangulation.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt contains the node information
      for the triangulation.  Each data line contains the X and 
      Y coordinates of a single node.
    </p>

    <p> 
      The input file <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt contains the triangle information
      for the triangulation.  Each line contains the indices of 3 or 6
      nodes that form a triangle.
    </p>

    <p>
      One motivation for creating this code is as follows.  Suppose
      we have a set of points that lie on the boundary or inside of
      a non-convex region.  If we naively call an unconstrained Delaunay
      triangulation routine, such as <b>TABLE_DELAUNAY</b>, then because
      the region is not convex, it is possible to create triangles which 
      lie outside the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      An easy way to correct this problem is to call a user routine
      and pass it the indices and coordinates of each triangle.  The
      user can then decide to drop any triangle whose centroid, say,
      lies outside the region.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other masking criteria might drop triangles that are too small,
      or that have too small an angle, or that lie inside some interior
      hole.  These choices are entirely up to the user.
    </p>

      Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      The user masking subroutine has the form:
      <blockquote>
        subroutine <b>triangle_mask</b> ( <i>dim_num</i>, <i>triangle_order</i>, 
          <i>nodes</i>, <i>coord</i>, <i>mask</i> )
      </blockquote>
      with arguments:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>dim_num</i>, the spatial dimension, always equal to 2.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>element_order</i>, the number of nodes in the element, usually 3
          or 6;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>nodes</i>, an integer array of dimension <i>element_order</i>,
          containing the indices of each node of the triangle;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>coord</i>, a real array of dimension <i>dim_num</i>
          by <i>element_order</i>, containing the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
          coordinates of each node of the triangle;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>mask</i>, a logical value, which is <b>true</b> if the 
          triangle should be deleted or "masked", and <b>false</b> if
          the triangle should be preserved;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The user masking routine must be compiled and linked with the
      software, perhaps with a command like:
      <blockquote>
        F90 <b>triangulation_mask.o</b> <i>triangle_mask.f90</i>
      </blockquote>
      We will assume that the executable is renamed to <b>triangulation_mask</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is the executed with a command like:
      <blockquote>
        <b>triangulation_mask</b> <i>prefix</i>
      </blockquote>
      where <i>prefix</i> is the common filename prefix:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_nodes.txt contains the node coordinates,
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_elements.txt contains the element definitions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_mask_nodes.txt is an output file which
          will contain the node coordinates retained by the mask;
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>prefix</i>_mask_elements.txt is an output file which
          will contain the defintions of elements retained by the mask.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

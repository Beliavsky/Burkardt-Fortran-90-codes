      <b>treepack</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      defines, analyzes, and manipulates trees,
      a simple kind of graph with no circuits.
      Special cases include rooted and binary trees.
      Representations include adjacency, arc, Pruefer code,
      and parent.
      Operations include center, diameter, eccentricity, enumeration,
      generation one at a time, random selection, traversal.
    </p>

    <p>
      A graph is a collection of objects or "nodes", such that any (unordered) pair of
      nodes is connected or not connected.  If a pair of nodes <b>i</b> and <b>j</b>
      are connected, we say there is an "edge" between them, and we may describe
      the edge as <b>(i,j)</b>.  A graph can be represented by a drawing
      of dots with lines connecting some of the dots.
    </p>

    <p>
      A tree is a minimally connected graph; more precisely, it is a graph
      with two additional properties:
      <ul>
        <li>
          it is <i>connected</i>, that is, given any two pair of nodes <b>i</b>
          and <b>j</b>, there is a sequence of edges <b>(na,nb),(nb,nc),...(nx,ny),(ny,nz)</b>
          such that <b>na=i</b> and <b>nz=j</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          if any edge is removed from the graph, it is no longer connected.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Note that a tree using <b>N</b> nodes will have exactly <b>N-1</b> edges.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are several ways to represent a graph on the computer.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_ARC</b> representation, we simply store a list of the edges
      of the tree, that is, pairs of nodes.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_PRUEFER</b> representation, a tree of <b>N</b> nodes 
      is represented by a sequence of <b>N-2</b> integers known as the
      Pruefer code.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_PARENT</b> representation, a tree of <b>N</b> nodes 
      is represented by a list of nodes PARENT, such that, for I = 1 to N - 1,
      the I-th edge of the tree connects node I to node PARENT(I).
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_ROOTED</b> representation, a tree is assumed to have the additional
      property that one node has been designated as the "root".
    </p>

    <p>
      For the <b>TREE_RB</b> representation, a tree is assumed to have the additional
      properties that one node has been designated as the "root", and that every node 
      has exactly 1 or 2 edges.

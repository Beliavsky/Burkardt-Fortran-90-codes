      <b>stripack_delaunay</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      interactively determines the Delaunay diagram of a set of points
      on a sphere.
    </p>

    <p>
      The set of points is read from a file, and the Delaunay triangulation,
      once computed, is written out to another file, described as a series
      of triplets of point indexes.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to Steven Fortune, it is possible to compute the Delaunay 
      triangulation of points on the surface of a sphere by computing their 
      convex hull, regarded as a 3D pointset.  If the sphere is the unit 
      sphere at the origin, the facet normals are the Voronoi vertices.

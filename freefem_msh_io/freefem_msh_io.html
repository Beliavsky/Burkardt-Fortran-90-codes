      <b>freefem_msh_io</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      reads and writes files used by the FreeFem++ finite element code
      to store mesh information.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that the GMSH code creates mesh files that use the ".msh"
      extension, but which are an entirely different format.
    </p>

    <p>
      The msh file format is obliquely described in section 12.5 of the
      FreeFem++ documentation.
    <p>

    <p>
      At least for the 2D case of a triangular mesh, the format seems 
      to be as follows:
      <ol>
        <li>
          a single line giving NV, NE, NT, the number of vertices, boundary edges, and triangles
        </li>
        <li>
          NV lines, each containing the (X,Y) coordinates and integer label for a node.
        </li>
        <li>
          NT lines, each containing three vertex indices and integer label for a triangle.
        </li>
        <li>
          NE lines, each containing two vertex indices and integer label for a boundary edge.
        </li>
      </ol>
      The "labels" seem to be "0" for interior objects and 1 for boundary objects.
      All edges are boundary objects.  (This might not be true.  A geometry
      might include internal edges, and perhaps these count as interior objects,
      but definitely, the edge list does not include arbitrary triangle edges,
      only those on the boundary.)  All triangles are interior objects.
      Vertices may be boundary or interior objects.

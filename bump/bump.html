      <b>bump</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      solves a 2D steady incompressible flow problem set in a channel 
      with a small bump.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a preliminary version of the flow() codes.
      It was designed to solve for the
      flow field in a channel with a parameterized bump.  Data for the flow
      profile downstream from the bump was given, and the idea was to determine
      a bump parameter value that produced the best match with the given
      profile.  In later programs, this task became much more elaborate.

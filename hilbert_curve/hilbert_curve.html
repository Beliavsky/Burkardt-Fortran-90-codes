    <p>
      <b>hilbert_curve</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      can convert between 1D and 2D coordinates of the Hilbert curve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mathematically, the Hilbert curve H is a continuous curve that passes
      through every point in the unit square.  Naturally, it is not possible
      to draw, or even to imagine, such a curve.  However, the Hilbert curve 
      can be described as the limit of a sequence of simpler curves Hn, where
      Hn is drawn by dividing the unit square into an NxN array of cells Cn 
      (where N is a power of 2), and connecting the cell centers.  The Hilbert curve 
      Hn will pass through each cell exactly once.
    </p>

    <p>
      Computationally, the Hilbert curve Hn is very useful.  It provides a 
      way of traversing a 2D array that tends to preserve locality.  It provides
      an interesting corresponding between points on the unit line segment [0,1],
      expressed as base 4 decimal fractions, and cells in the sequence of nested 
      squares Cn.  For instance, the point whose base four decimal expansion 
      begins 0.312... can be located by going to the 4th cell of H2, then when that
      cell gets subdivided, going to the second cell, then when that cell gets 
      subdivided, going to the third cell.  (Note that, in order for the Hilbert
      curve to be connected, each time a cell is subdivided, the ordering of the
      subcells is rotated or flipped in a regular way.)

      <b>medit_mesh_io_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls medit_mesh_io(), which
      reads or writes files used by the MEDIT program, which can be used to 
      define the a mesh associated with the finite element method (FEM) 
      in 2D or 3D, using triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedrons or hexahedrons.

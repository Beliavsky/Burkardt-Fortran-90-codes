      <b>candy_count_test</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      calls candy_count(), which
      counts the types of candy in a rectangular container, which might be
      a vector, matrix, or 3D box.  The candy is assumed to have C possible
      types, and to have been entered into the container in a cycle that
      begins with type 1.  While the vector case is easy, it is already 
      difficult to come up with a general formula for the MxN matrix case.

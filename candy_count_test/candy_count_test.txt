candy_count_test():
  Fortran90 version
  Test candy_count().

candy_count_vector_test():
  candy_count_vector() counts candy types in a vector.
  There are N entries in the vector A().
  There are C candy types.
  Candy types are assigned cyclically to vector entries:
  A(I) = mod ( i - 1, c ) + 1
  Count the number of candies of each type.

  Count using candy_count_vector()
  Fix value of C =    4
  Consider a range of values of N:

   N    #1  #2  #3  #4

   3     1   1   1   0
   4     1   1   1   1

   9     3   2   2   2
  10     3   3   2   2

  Repeat calculation, using candy_count_vector_sum()

candy_count_matrix_test():
  candy_count_matrix() counts candy types in a matrix.
  There are MxN entries in the matrix A().
  There are C candy types.
  Candy types are assigned cyclically to matrix entries:
  A(I,J) = mod ( i + j - 2, c ) + 1
  Count the number of candies of each type.

  Count using candy_count_matrix()

candy_count_box_test():
  candy_count_box() counts candy types in a 3D box.
  There are LxMxN entries in the box A().
  There are C candy types.
  Candy types are assigned cyclically to matrix entries:
  A(I,J,K) = mod ( i + j + k - 3, c ) + 1
  Count the number of candies of each type.

  Count using candy_count_box()

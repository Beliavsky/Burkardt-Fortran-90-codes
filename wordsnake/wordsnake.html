      <b>wordsnake</b>
      a Fortran90 code which
      tries to find a good solution to the "Wordsnake Puzzle", in which
      a list of words is reordered, trying to maximize the overlap of
      successive words.
    <p>

    <p>
      The code is given a list of words and tries to arrange them
      in a list so that the end of one word has maximum overlap with the
      beginning of the next word.  The entire list is called a "wordsnake",
      and is scored by squaring the overlaps of each consecutive pair, and
      adding.  We allow the wordsnake to "wraparound", so there's one extra
      score for overlap from the last word to the first.

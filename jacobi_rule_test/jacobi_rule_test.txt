JACOBI_RULE
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  Compute a Gauss-Jacobi rule for approximating
    Integral ( A <= x <= B ) (B-x)^alpha (x-A)^beta f(x) dx
  of order ORDER.
 
  The user specifies ORDER, ALPHA, BETA, A, B, and FILENAME.
 
  ORDER is the number of points:
  ALPHA is the exponent of (B-X)
  BETA is the exponent of (X-A):
  A is the left endpoint;
  B is the right endpoint;
  FILENAME is used to generate 3 files:
    filename_w.txt - the weight file
    filename_x.txt - the abscissa file.
    filename_r.txt - the region file.
 
  Input summary:
 
  ORDER =        4
  ALPHA =   0.500000    
  BETA =    1.50000    
  A =   -1.00000    
  B =    1.00000    
  OUTPUT = "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5".
 
  Creating quadrature files.
 
  "Root" file name is   "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5".
 
  Weight file will be   "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5_w.txt".
  Abscissa file will be "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5_x.txt".
  Region file will be   "jac_o4_a0.5_b1.5_r.txt".
 
JACOBI_RULE:
  Normal end of execution.

      <b>snakes_and_ladders_simulation</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      investigates the game of Snakes and Ladders.
    </p>

    <p>
      Snakes and Ladders is a children's game played on a 10x10 numbered
      board.  A player's turn consists of rolling a single die, and moving
      the indicated number of squares.  If the final square is the foot of
      a ladder, the player moves up to a higher numbered square.  If the
      final square is the mouth of a snake, the player moves downward.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is a simple exercise to create a simulation of the game for 
      several players.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the game is essentially a race, with no other competition between
      the players, it can be studied in a simplified version in which there
      is only one player.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the one-player version of the game, it is interesting to pose the
      question of the average length of a game, that is, how many rolls of
      the die it takes in order to reach the final square.
    </p>

    <p>
      By adding a square 0, where the player begins, the game board can
      be modeled as a vector of length 101, and the transitions from one
      square to another can be modeled by a transition matrix.  Most commonly,
      the entries in row I will be zero except that columns I+1 through
      I+6 will have the value 1/6.  However, rows which correspond to a 
      snake or ladder, and rows for which I+6 is greater than 100, must
      be handled specially.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given the transition matrix A, the one player game can be modeled as 
      a Markov Chain Monte Carlo system.  In particular, given an initial
      starting vector v, the probability distribution after one move is
      the vector A' * v, and repeated multiplication by A' will display
      the exact probability distribution at every step.

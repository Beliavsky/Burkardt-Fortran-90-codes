    <p>
      <b>steam_interact</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      allows the user to interactively query the 
      steam table functions from the National Bureau of Standards (NBS).
    </p>

    <p>
      The user can specify temperature
      and pressure, or temperature and density, and the program will
      return the computed values of a variety of quantities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Most of these routines use a standard set of SI units.
      The original routines were written in FORTRAN77.  This FORTRAN90 version
      has been extensively rewritten, with some additional routines
      for computing quantities such as the viscosity, thermal
      conductivity, and the Prandtl number.

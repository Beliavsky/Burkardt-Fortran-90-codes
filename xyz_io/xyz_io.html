      <b>xyz_io</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      reads and writes simple graphics files in the XYZ, XYZL and XYZF formats.
    </p>

    <p>
      XYZ files are a simple way of storing information about sets of points in 3D.
    </p>

    <p>
      An XYZ file has a simple structure.  There are three kinds of records:
      <ul>
        <li>
          COMMENT LINES begin with the character '#' and are ignored;
        </li>
        <li>
          BLANK LINES are ignored;
        </li>
        <li>
          COORDINATE LINES each contain one triple of XYZ coordinates;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is an example of an XYZ file containing 13 points:
      <pre>
#  cube.xyz
#
        0.000000        0.000000        0.000000
        1.000000        0.000000        0.000000
        1.000000        1.000000        0.000000
        0.000000        1.000000        0.000000
        0.000000        0.000000        1.000000
        1.000000        0.000000        1.000000
        1.000000        1.000000        1.000000
        0.000000        1.000000        1.000000
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Of course, in many cases, we would like to describe LINES between the points.
      We can add this information by including a second file, called an XYZL file,
      which consists of a string of point indices.  A line is drawn from one point
      to the next, and so on, through all the points index on the record.  Thus, an XYZL file
      associated with the above XYZ file might be:
      <pre>
#  cube.xyzl
#
  1 2 3 4 1
  5 6 7 8 5
  1 5
  2 6
  3 7
  4 8
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      We might also like to describe FACES defined by the points.
      We can add this information by including a file, called an XYZF file,
      which consists of a string of point indices.  A face is defined by
      listing in counterclockwise order the vertices that lie on it.
      The first vertex is not repeated
      as the final vertex. Thus, an XYZF file
      associated with the above XYZ file might be:
      <pre>
#  cube.xyzf
#
  1 4 3 2
  2 3 7 6
  5 6 7 8
  5 8 4 1
  1 2 6 5
  3 4 8 7
      </pre>

      <b>tetrahedron_jaskowiec_rule</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      returns quadrature rules, with exactness up to total degree 20,
      over the interior of a tetrahedron in 3D,
      by Jan Jaskowiec, Natarajan Sukumar.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quadrature rules are described in terms of barycentric coordinates
      (a,b,c,d), with weights w that sum to 1.

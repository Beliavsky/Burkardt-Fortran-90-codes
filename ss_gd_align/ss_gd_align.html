      <b>ss_gd_align</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      implements some of the linear space alignment
      algorithms described in the reference by Chao.
    </p>

    <p>
      A global
      alignment is attempted between the strings, and similarity is measured by
      a sort of distance.  These algorithms carry out the computation in
      <I>linear space</I>, and compute not just the optimal alignment
      score, but the corresponding optimal alignment.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to be able to compute alignments using "linear space",
      that is, just a few vectors whose length <b>N</b> is equal to that
      of a typical string.  A quadratic algorithm would require a two
      dimensional array of total dimension <b>N*N</b>.  Realistic alignment
      problems can involve strings of <b>N</b>=100,000 elements or more,
      so a quadratic algorithm would be expensive or impossible to use.
    </p>

    <p>
      The score for the actual best matching is determined without
      constructing the best matching, and in fact it is a matter of some
      difficulty to recover the matching, particularly if the algorithm is a
      linear space one, which discards a great deal of intermediate information.
      However, a linear space algorithm included here can also compute the
      optimal matching, based on the idea of a recursive subdivision of the
      problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Routines that use quadratic space are included as well, so the algorithms
      can be compared for storage, speed, and correctness.

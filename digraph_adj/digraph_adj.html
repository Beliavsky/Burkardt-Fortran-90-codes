      <a href = "digraph_adj.html">
      digraph_adj</a>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      carries out operations on digraphs, a directed graph.
      Information is stored in an adjacency matrix.
      Operations include computing in- and out-degrees,
      computing the in- and out-degree sequences, counting the edges,
      printing the adjacency matrix, generating fixed and random examples.

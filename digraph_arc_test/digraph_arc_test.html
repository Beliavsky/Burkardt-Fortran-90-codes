      <b>digraph_arc_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out operations on digraphs, a directed graph.
      Information is stored in an arc list, pairs of nodes forming edges.
      Operations include computing in- and out-degrees,
      computing the in- and out-degree sequences, counting the edges,
      printing the arc list, generating fixed and random examples.

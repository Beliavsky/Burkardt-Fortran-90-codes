      <b>dqed</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      solves (square) systems of nonlinear equations, or minimizes the
      residual in a set of nonlinear equations, using least squares,
      by Richard Hanson and Fred Krogh.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user may include simple bounds or linear constraints on variables.
    </p>

    <p>
      DQED can solve, in the least squares sense, systems of linear
      or nonlinear equations, with inequality bounds or equality constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      DQED was written by Richard Hanson and Fred Krogh of Sandia
      National Laboratory.
    </p>

    <p>
      The original Fortran77 source code is available through NETLIB at<br>

      Overview
    </h3>

    <p>
      DQED solves the constrained nonlinear least squares problem:
    </p>

    <p>
      Minimize the sum of squares of MEQUA generally nonlinear equations,
      </p><blockquote>
        f(1:MEQUA)(x) = 0,  Equation (1)
      </blockquote>
      where x is a set of NVARS unknowns.  The vector function with these MEQUA
      components is called f(x) in the discussion that follows.
    <p></p>

    <p>
      The components of x may have upper and lower bounds given by the user.  In
      fact, all of the possible cases can be specified:
      </p><ul>
        <li>
          no bounds on X;
        </li>
        <li>
          bounds at one end only;
        </li>
        <li>
          upper and lower bounds.
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Linear constraints on the unknowns, more general than simple bounds, can also
      be given.  These linear constraints can be of the equality or inequality type:
      </p><blockquote>
        a(L,1) x(1)+ ... + a(L,NVARS) x(NVARS) = y(L), L = 1,...,MCON,  Equation (2)
      </blockquote>
      with bounds specified on the right hand side values y(L), again given by the
      user.  The constraints can actually be slightly nonlinear.  In this case
      the constraints can be described as:
      <blockquote>
        g(L)(x) =  y(L), L = 1,...,MCON,  Equation (2')
      </blockquote>
      where bounds are specified on each y(L).  The functions g(L)(x) must be defined
      for all x in the set described by the simple bounds.
    <p></p>

    <p>
      Experienced users may wish to turn directly to the examples before reading the
      subprogram documentation.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no size relation required for the problem dimensions MEQUA, NVARS, and
      MCON except that MEQUA and NVARS are both positive, and MCON is nonnegative.
    </p>

    <p>
      DQED will do a decent job of solving most nonlinear
      least squares problems that can be expressed as Equations (1) and (2)
      above, provided that continuous derivatives of the functions
      with respect to the parameters can be computed.  This can also
      include problems where the derivatives must be computed using
      some form of numerical differentiation.  Numerical
      differentiation is not provided with this software for solving
      nonlinear least squares problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      The authors also plan to develop methods that will do a much
      better job of coping with constraints more general than the
      essentially linear ones indicated above in Equations (2)-(2').  There
      are nonlinear least squares problems with innocent-looking but
      highly nonlinear constraints where this package will fail to
      work.  The authors also hope to reduce the overhead required by
      the software.  This high overhead is due primarily to the method
      used to solve the inner-loop quadratic model problem.  The
      authors recommend that users consider using the option number
      14, to suppress use of the quadratic model.  The
      user may find that the software works quite well without the
      quadratic model.  This may be important when the function and
      derivatives evaluations are not expensive but many individual
      problems are being solved.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two fundamental ways to use the subprogram DQED.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most straightforward way is to make one call to DQED and obtain values
      for the unknowns, x.  The user provides a subprogram DQEDEV that gives
      DQED the values of the functions f(x) and g(x), and the derivative or Jacobian
      matrices for f(x) and g(x) at each desired point x.  This usage is called
      'forward communication.'
    </p>

    <p>
      An alternate way to use DQED is to provide an option that allows the user to
      communicate these values by 'reverse communication.'  DQED returns to the
      user calling program and requests values for f(x) and g(x), and the Jacobian
      matrices for f(x) and g(x) for a given value of x.  This framework is often
      required in applications that have complicated algorithmic requirements for
      evaluation of the functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Examples using both 'forward' and 'reverse' communication are provided.

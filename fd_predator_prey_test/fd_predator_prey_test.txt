FD_PREDATOR_PREY
  FORTRAN90 version
 
  A finite difference approximate solution of a pair
  of ordinary differential equations for a population
  of predators and prey.
 
  The exact solution shows wave behavior, with a fixed
  period and amplitude.  The finite difference
  approximation can provide a good estimate for this
  behavior if the stepsize DT is small enough.
 
  Initial time    =    0.00000    
  Final time      =    5.00000    
  Initial prey    =    5000.00    
  Initial pred    =    100.000    
  Number of steps =      100

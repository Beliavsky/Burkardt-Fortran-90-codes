      <b>helmholtz_openmp_test</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      calls helmholtz_openmp(), which
      solves the discretized Helmholtz equation in 2D
      using the OpenMP application program interface
      for carrying out parallel computations in a shared memory environment.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code solves the Helmholtz equation on a rectangular grid, 
      using Jacobi iteration with overrelaxation to solve the
      associated linear equations.

      <b>candy_count</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      counts the types of candy in a rectangular container, which might be
      a vector, matrix, or 3D box.  The candy is assumed to have C possible
      types, and to have been entered into the container in a cycle that
      begins with type 1.  While the vector case is easy, it is already 
      difficult to come up with a general formula for the MxN matrix case. 
    </p>

    <p>
      We are given a (rectangular) container of candy containing C distinct 
      types, and asked to report how many of each type there are.
    </p>

    <p>
      The container has been filled by a machine, which automatically
      starts with candy type 1, then puts candy type 2 in the next open
      position, and so on, until candy type C is used, at which point
      the machine cycles back to candy type 1, repeating this process
      until the container is filled.
    </p>

    <p>
      we want to know how many candies of each type there are.
      We could imagine simply dumping out the container and counting.
      But is there a mathematical way to do this, based on the shape 
      of the container.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can imagine three simple cases, in which the candy comes in
      a rectangular container which can be thought of as a vector
      of length N, or an M by N matrix, or an L by M by N box.
      The counting is simple for the vector, but is already tricky
      for the case of a matrix.
    </p> 

    <p>
      As an illustration, here is a M=10 by N=13 matrix, containing C=4 
      candy types, with 33 examples of types 1 and 2, and 32 examples of
      types 3 and 4.

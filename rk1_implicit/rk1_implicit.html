    <p>
      <b>rk1_implicit</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      solves one or more ordinary differential equations (ODE)
      using the Runge-Kutta order 1 implicit method, using fsolve() 
      to solve the implicit equation, and using a fixed time step.
      rk1_implicit() is commonly called the backward Euler method.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each step requires the solution of an implicit nonlinear equation.  A 
      corresponding function has been devised, called fsolve_be(), which 
      carries out the iterative solution process.

      <b>graph_adj</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      carries out operations on abstract graphs, with undirected edges,
      represented by an adjancency matrix.  Operations include breadth-first
      search, the computation of a minimum spanning tree,
      an Euler or Hamilton circuit, blocks, chromatic polynomial, or transitive
      closure.

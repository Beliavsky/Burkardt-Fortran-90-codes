    <p>
      <b>hexahedron_witherden_rule</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      returns a Witherden quadrature rule, with exactness up to total degree 11,
      over the interior of a hexahedron.
    </p>

    <p>
       The unit hexahedron has vertices 
         (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,1), (1,1,1), (0,1,1).

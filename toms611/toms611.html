      <b>toms611</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      carries out the unconstrained minimization of
      a scalar function, by David Gay.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is a FORTRAN90 implementation of
      ACM TOMS algorithm 611.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code contains routines for the general unconstrained
      minimization of a scalar function of several variables.  The routines
      use a model/trust-region approach, and the double-dogleg technique
      of Dennis and Mei.  In cases where the Hessian is not supplied by the
      user, the BFGS secant update is used instead.
    </p>

    <p>
      Three different implementations of the algorithm are available,
      which allow the user to supply just the function, the function
      and gradient, or function, gradient and hessian.
    </p>

    <p>
      The user may also choose to supply the information about the
      function through subroutines, or to use a version of the algorithm
      that employs "reverse communication", allowing the user to
      evaluate the function in any suitable way.
    </p>

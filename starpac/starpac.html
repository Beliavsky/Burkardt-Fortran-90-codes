      <b>starpac</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      performs statistical data analysis.  It includes functions for nonlinear 
      least squares regression, time series analysis in both time and 
      frequency domains), line printer graphics, basic statistical analysis, 
      and linear least squares regression, by Janet Donaldson.
    </p>

    <p>
      starpac() uses a COMMON block and EQUIVALENCE statements
      in order to make workspace storage available to its routines.
      This scheme assumes that an integer is stored in one word.
      When compiling this program with the gnu g95() compiler, it may be 
      necessary to include the <b>-i4</b> switch, to guarantee that integers
      are stored in 4 bytes = one word.  Otherwise, routines that
      rely on the workspace storage system will fail.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some updates to the original Fortran77 code include:
      <ul>
        <p>
          Basic conversion to Fortran90 format, although many archaic
          structures remain, include common blocks and equivalence statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Source code for erf(), erfc() and gamma() removed;
          intrinsic functions are called instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The subroutine stat() was renamed stat_external() to avoid
          conflict with an intrinsic stat() function.  Various
          calls and declarations had to be correspondingly updated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dstak() array was uniformly redimensioned to size 3000;
          Previously, it was generally dimensioned as size 12, but
          some functions expected it to have signficantly more storage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several obsolete arithmetic goto statements were replaced
          by corresponding if/elseif/else statements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Numerous statements were corrected, in which an array argument, 
          say "xmiss", was supposed to be followed by a scalar value.
          Instead, these statements had the form ",xmiss,xmiss,".  Presumably,
          the second value was actually not used, and so the value "xmiss"
          was repeated as a filler.  However, the receiving subroutine 
          expected a scalar value for that argument, and this triggered an
          error.  Most of these errors were suppressed simply by replacing
          ",xmiss,xmiss," by ",xmiss,xmiss(1),", turning the second argument
          into a scalar, and relying on the likelihood that the subroutine
          actually had no need for this information anyway.  Before this
          change, the gfortran compiler would allow the original statements
          as long as it was invoked with the flag "-fallow-argument-mismatch".
          This problem and the gfortran workaround were reported by Vivek
          Rao.

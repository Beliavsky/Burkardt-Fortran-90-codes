normal_dataset():
  Fortran90 version
  Generate a multivariate normal random dataset.
 
  The program requests input values from the user:
 
  * M, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * SEED, a positive integer.
  * MU, the mean vector.
  * A, the variance-covariance matrix.
 
  The program generates the data and
  writes it to the file
 
    normal_M_N.txt
 
  where "M" and "N" are the numeric values.
 
  Spatial dimension M =        2
 
  Number of points N =     1000
 
  Seed SEED =    123456789
 
  Mean vector MU:
 
         1     1.0000000    
         2     2.0000000    
 
  Variance/covariance matrix A:
 
  Col          1             2      
  Row
 
    1       1.            0.      
    2       0.            3.      
 
  The data was written to the file "normal_02_01000.txt".
 
normal_dataset():
  Normal end of execution.

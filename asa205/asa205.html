    <p>
      <b>asa205</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      enumerates contingency tables.
    </p>

    <p>
      The code is Applied Statistics Algorithm 205.
    </p>

    <p>
      This algorithm
      generates contingency tables, which are <b>M</b> by <b>N</b> tables
      of nonnegative integers with specified row and column sums.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, for the row sum vector <b>(1,3)</b> and column sum
      vector <b>(1,1,2)</b>, there are "essentially" only the two
      solutions:
      <pre>
        0  0  1
        1  1  1
      </pre>
      and
      <pre>
        0  1  0
        1  0  2
      </pre>
      We could generate another solution by permuting the first two columns
      of the second solution, but ASA205 doesn't consider that a
      distinct solution.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that it is possible to specify a problem for which there are
      <i>no</i> corresponding contingency tables at all.  The simplest
      way is if the row and column sum vectors don't themselves sum up
      to the same value.  But there is also a "technical" condition
      that the two vectors have to satisfy in order for a solution to exist.

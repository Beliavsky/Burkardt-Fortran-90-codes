      <b>eigs</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which
      calculates the eigenvalues of a real matrix.
    </p>

    <p>
      In cases like MATLAB, Octave, and Python, there is a standard
      built-in function for computing eigenvalues which is appropriate
      for this task, and we simply supply a code eigs_test() to demonstrate
      its use.
    </p>

    <p>
      In other cases, particularly C, C++, Fortran77 and Fortran90,
      pre-existing eigenvalue software has been rearranged and packaged
      to form a simple function of the form eigs(n,A,lambda), which
      saves the user from the usual trouble of arranging a proper call.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here, the Fortran90 version of eigs() relies on a call to the lapack() 
      function dgeev() to produce its results.  It is assumed that a
      precompiled copy of the lapack() library is available at link time.

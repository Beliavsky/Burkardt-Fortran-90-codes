      <b>matrix_chain_dynamic</b>,
      a Fortran90 code which 
      finds the cost of the most efficient ordering to use when
      multiplying a sequence of matrices, using dynamic programming.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are given a sequence of n matrices of conformable dimensions.
      Matrix Ai has D(i) rows and D(i+1) columns.  
      The product A1 * A2 * ... * An is to be computed.  
      In terms of scalar multiplications, the cost of computing
      A(i) * A(i+1) is D(i) * D(i+1) * D(i+2).
      We may carry out the pairs of multiplication in any order we wish.  
      The total cost of the computation will, in general, vary depending
      on the order in which we compute the individual matrix multiplications.
      The goal of the algorithm is simply to determine the cost of the
      most efficient ordering.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given n matrices, there are (n-1)! possible orderings for the 
      sequence of matrix multiplications.  One approach to determining
      the minimum cost would be to consider each of these orderings,
      but this is considered a wasteful and inefficient approach for
      large values of n.  The code given here depends instead on a 
      dynamic programming approach.  As such, it requires several
      n by n arrays in order to store intermediate information.
      Thus it needs n^2 space, and the algorithm takes on the order
      of n^3 operations to determine the result.

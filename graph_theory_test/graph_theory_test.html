      <b>graph_theory_test</b>,
      a FORTRAN90 code which
      calls graph_theory(), which
      carries out operations on abstract graphs, such as a breadth-first-search, 
      the computation of a minimum spanning tree,
      an Euler or Hamilton circuit, blocks, chromatic polynomial, or transitive
      closure.  Objects include undirected and directed graphs, weighted
      graphs, and trees.
